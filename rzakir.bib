abstract="We study how robot swarms can achieve a consensus on the best among a set of n possible options available in the environment. While the robots rely on local communication with one another, follow simple rules, and make estimates of the option's qualities subject to measurement errors, the swarm as a whole is able to make accurate collective decisions. We compare the performance of two prominent decision-making algorithms that are based, respectively, on the direct-switching and the cross-inhibition models, both of which are well-suited for simplistic robots. Most studies used these models to let robots achieve consensus by solely relying on social interactions and ignored the aspect of enabling robots to self-source information from the environment. However, in order to select the best option, we deem sampling environmental information crucial for the successful performance of the task. Through robot-swarm simulations, we show that swarms programmed with the direct-switching model are only able to make consensus decisions in asymmetric environments where options have different quality values. Instead, using cross-inhibition, the robot swarm can also break decision deadlocks and reach a consensus in symmetric environments with equal quality options. We investigate the mechanistic causes of such differences and we find that the time the robots spend in a state of indecision is a key parameter to break the symmetry. This research highlights the importance of considering both social and environmental information when studying collective decision-making.",

abstract = {In collective decision-making, individuals in a swarm reach consensus on a decision using only local interactions without any centralized control. In the context of the best-of-n problem - characterized by n discrete alternatives - it has been shown that consensus to the best option can be reached if individuals disseminate that option more than the other options. Besides being used as a mechanism to modulate positive feedback, long dissemination times could potentially also be used in an adversarial way, whereby adversarial swarms could infiltrate the system and propagate bad decisions using aggressive dissemination strategies. Motivated by the above scenario, in this paper we propose a bio-inspired defence strategy that allows the swarm to be resilient against options that can be disseminated for longer times. This strategy mainly consists in reducing the mobility of the agents that are associated to options disseminated for a shorter amount of time, allowing the swarm to converge to this option. We study the effectiveness of this strategy using two classical decision mechanisms, the voter model and the majority rule, showing that the majority rule is necessary in our setting for this strategy to work. The strategy has also been validated on a real Kilobots experiment.},

abstract="In swarm robotics, self-organized aggregation refers to a collective process in which robots form a single aggregate in an arbitrarily chosen aggregation site among those available in the environment, or just in an arbitrarily chosen location. Instead of focusing exclusively on the formation of a single aggregate, in this study we discuss how to design a swarm of robots capable of generating a variety of final distributions of the robots to the available aggregation sites. We focus on an environment with two possible aggregation sites, A and B. Our study is based on the following working hypothesis: robots distribute on site A and B in quantities that reflect the relative proportion of robots in the swarm that selectively avoid A with respect to those that selectively avoid B. This is with an as minimal as possible proportion of robots in the swarm that selectively avoid one or the other site. We illustrate the individual mechanisms designed to implement the above mentioned working hypothesis, and we discuss the promising results of a set of simulations that systematically consider a variety of experimental conditions.",
